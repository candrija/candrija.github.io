# Hi! My name is Carson Andrijanoff
## I'm a Mechanical Engineering Student at The University of North Carolina Charlotte and this website is a repository for all of my interesting creative endeavors.


### **Solidworks Projects**
+ Junior Design - Pick and Place Robot
    *Extensive Solidworks project to design physical components for an automated pick and place robot for my Spring 2021 Junior Design course.*
    *Full Model, component, and exploded views below.*
+ Cherry Style Keyswitch Model
    *Recently experienced a hard drive loss - an image of a Linear Cherry MX style keyswitch assembly is below. Currently trying to recover these models however this is      unlikely. Used Engineering Drawings from Cherry and Gateron to make a Solidworks assembly - all parts started from dimesnional values and generated by me.*
+ FSAE Student Suspension Development
    *Experience developing a stand-in simplified suspension strut for use in a full FSAE Formula car assembly. Included only the maximum outer dimensions of an existing damper and spring combo to avoid using the manufacturer's high part count assembly, allowing for higher computer performance on lower end systems struggling to render the complex OEM CAD model.

### **KiCAD Project**
+ PCB Design for Custom 40% Mechanical Keyboard
